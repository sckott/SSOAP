  <dt>
      Does the package handle all SOAP types?
  <dd>
      It currently doesn't handle arrays completely.
      Specifically, it gets the single dimension array case,
      but doesn't handle multi-dimensional arrays yet.
      This is not that hard, but simply hasn't been done yet.

  <dt> How are compound SOAP types handled?
  <dd>
      By default, compound objects are converted to S3 objects.
      The XML elements in the SOAP tree are mapped to named
      elements in the S3 list. The names of the XML elements
      are used as names in the S list.
      The value of each element in the S list is generated
      by calling <code>fromSOAP()</code>
      on that sub-node of the XML tree.
      In other words, <code>fromSOAP</code> works recursively.

  <dt> Why not use S4 classes for compound SOAP types?
  <dd>
      Ideally, we would. But when we see a compound SOAP object,
      we don't necessarily have a class definition for it.
      We could define one based on the type, but we don't
      know that if we were to see the same basic SOAP type
      again it would have the same fields or types.
      Without an external definition for the class, we can't
      define a general class based on a single instance.
      However, this is exactly the strength of the S3 classes.

  <dt> Does the package implement a SOAP server?
  <dd>
      No. In man respects, it is better to implement
      a SOAP server that uses S functionality
      via another programming language such as Perl, Python
      or Java.
      Since each of the systems has SOAP server capabilities
      and R can be embedded in those systems, one can easily
      implement a server that makes calls to S functions
      there.
      <p>
      If you really want to implement a SOAP server directly
      in S, you can use
      <code>socketConnection()</code> to listen for requests
      and the primitives provided by the SSOAP and
      XML packages for S to process the HTTP and XML content and
      implement the methods.
      Doing so is not very hard, but details such as fault tolerance,
      etc.

  <dt>
      The <code>.SOAP()</code> functionseems very slow.
      What's the problem?
  <dd>
      Not certain.
      There is of course a great deal of variation in the speed.
      The usual factors such as how heavily loaded
      your machine is, how much memory it has, etc.
      are somewhat relevant. But of course,
      network connectivity is the primary bottleneck.
      However, even with this variation, the response
      time does seem less favorable than compared
      with Perl's SOAP::Lite.
      And, if there is a problem, it seems to be in the
      low-level code associated with
      <code>readLines</code> on a <code>socketConnection</code>.
      So I don't think  the problem is in the SSOAP package.

  <dt> In almost every call to <code>.SOAP()</code>,
      I get a warning such as
<pre>
Warning message: 
incomplete final line found by readLines on `->services.soaplite.com:80'       
</pre>
      Is this a real problem?
  <dd>
     You can safely ignore this. It arises because R
      things that input on every connection should end with a new
      line.
      However, when HTTP servers frequently write their messages
      without this new line.

  <dt> Why is there no way to specify a SOAP Header to the message?
  <dd>
      Because I haven't implemented it yet!
      If you have need for it, please contact me
      and let me know some of the details. I am looking
      for good examples and motivation to add this.


  <dt> Why isn't the XML message created using
      the tools in the XML package, e.g.
      XMLOutputBuffer,
      XMLOutputDOM, xmlTree, etc.?
  <dd>
      This will be used in the near future.
      We used this raw approach
      for the purpose of testing the basic
      communication with the HTTP server
      and had to deal with many details
      that redirected our attention.
      These XML tools are much easier to use
      and more robust.
